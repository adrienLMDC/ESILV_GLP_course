# TD4/9: Work with secured distant communication tools

## Exercise 1: SSH
1. Create an account on a cloud computing platform (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud)
— You must enter your credit card number, I have no affiliation
— It is free. Delete the account in few month to prevent any fee
```
I created an AWS account.
```
2. Create a server instance on the website of your cloud platform (ec2 for AWS, Standard B1s for Azure)
```
I created an EC2 instance
```
3. Connect to the distant server via your terminal
— Do chmod 400 your private key file. The connection won’t work otherwise
— Use an SSH instruction to connect to your remote instance
— Exit to return to your local machine

4. Create a script named connect.sh to automatically connect to the remote instance  
```
nano connect.sh

#!/bin/bash

ssh -i ...
```
5. Run the script to check it is working properly. Then exit to return to your local machine.
```
source connect.sh

exit
```
6. Rename your private key to make it a hidden file. Propagate the changes to your script. Run the script.

## Exercise 2: SCP
1. On your local machine create a file named test_to_remote_instance.txt 
```
touch test_to_remote_instance.txt
```
2. Connect to your remote instance and create a file named test_from_remote_instance.txt. Then exit 
```
source connect.sh
touch test_to_remote_instance.txt
```  

3. Use the scp command to :
— Send your file test_to_remote_instance.txt to the home folder of your remote instance
— Get the file test_from_remote_instance.txt to your current local directory 
```
scp  ec2-user@ip... :/ ~/test_to_remote_instance.txt adrien@... :/ ~
```
4. Create two scripts :
— scp_to_remote_instance.sh and scp_from_remote_instance.sh to respectively send and get data with your remote instance
— Since you would like to send or receive any file (not just the test file),
your scripts should use the path of the file to send / receive as an
argument
5. Test your scripts with varying files
